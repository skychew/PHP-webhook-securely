Mutual TLS (mTLS) is an excellent choice to secure your webhook further, as it involves both the client and the server presenting certificates to authenticate their identity. To add client verification using Mutual TLS, you'll need to perform the following steps:

1 - Acquire or generate a CA (Certificate Authority) certificate, server certificate and private key, and client certificate and private key. There are several ways to do this:

Obtain certificates from a public CA (such as Let's Encrypt) or an internal CA if you have one.
Create a self-signed CA certificate and generate server and client certificates signed by this CA. You can use OpenSSL to do this.

2 - Configure your server to require client certificates. The exact steps vary depending on your web server. Here's an example of how to do this with Nginx:

First, edit your Nginx configuration file (usually located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or /etc/nginx/sites-available/default).

Add the following lines inside the server block:

vbnet
====code
>ssl_client_certificate /path/to/ca.crt;
>ssl_verify_client on;
>ssl_verify_depth 1;

Replace /path/to/ca.crt with the path to your CA certificate file.

Save the changes and restart Nginx:

====code
>sudo nginx -t
>sudo service nginx restart

3 - Update the client code to use the client certificate and private key when sending requests to the webhook. Here's an example of how to do this with PHP and cURL:

webhook_mTLS.php

Replace /path/to/client.crt and /path/to/client.key with the paths to your client certificate and private key files.

Now, when the client sends a request to the webhook, it will present its certificate for authentication. The server will verify the client certificate against the configured CA certificate, and only allow connections from clients with valid certificates. This ensures that
